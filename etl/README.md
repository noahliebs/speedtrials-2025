```

2. Run the loader:

cd etl
chmod +x data_load.sh
./data_load.sh
```

## ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning Highlights

The ETL process includes smart data validation and cleanup:

### âœ… Bug 1: Missing `violation_id`
- Rows missing this required field are skipped.
- Logged to `violations_skipped.log`.

### âœ… Bug 2: Filler characters like `--->`
- Replaced with NULLs during cleanup.

### âœ… Bug 3: Extra trailing commas
- Some rows had 39 fields when 38 expected.
- Cleaner trims blank columns at the end.

### âœ… Bug 4: Improperly quoted NULLs (`""`)
- Converted to proper nulls so date parsing and numeric conversion work in PostgreSQL.

- âœ… Row counts per table
